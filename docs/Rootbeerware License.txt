------------------

For those concerned with the legal ramifications of this license, it is based on the "Simplified BSD License" or "FreeBSD License" with the following changes:

Removed from #2 - The requirement to include the list of conditions in a binary redistribution has been removed; you only need to include the copyright notice.

Added #3 - You may modify and redistribute source code packages as you see fit; however, you must change the Product Name and Package File Name in VI Package Manager, and change the names of any LabVIEW lvlib files included in the package.  The intent of this requirement is to prevent conflicts between your modified code and the original package.  For internal redistributions I recommend using a <CompanyName>.LapDog.<etc> namespace convention.  Public redistributions probably should avoid using "LapDog" at all in the namespace.

Added #4 - Obviously this is a completely optional requirement.  To be honest, I like hearing that people are using tools I create.  It makes me feel good, and feeling good is what keep me motivated during the late nights and long weekends of preparing packages for distribution.


In short, I want you to use this software in whatever way works best for you.  You are free to include it in commercial applications, in source code distributions, training materials, etc.  There are two uses I don't particularly like, but do not specifically prevent:

1. Redistributing the package or minor derivatives of the package as a LabVIEW add-on and charging a fee for it.  If you're charging a fee for works that include this package--either as source code or binary form--the fee should be commensurate with the value you have added.  I'm not looking to profit from my work on this and I don't think you should profit from my work either.

2. Redestributing the package or minor derivatives of the package as a LabVIEW add-on and claiming the work as your own.  That's just wrong.
